Solowiznde Tech — Static website bundle
--------------------------------------

Files included:
- index.html        -> The single-page site
- styles.css        -> CSS used by the page
- scripts.js        -> Small JS for vCard download, mailto form, copy phone
- README.md         -> This file

How to use:
1. Unzip the archive and upload the files to your static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel, or your web host).
2. If you want a custom domain, point your domain's DNS to your host per their instructions.
3. To add portfolio images, create an 'assets' folder and drop images there; update the Portfolio section in index.html.
4. If you want on-site form submissions (instead of mailto), you'll need server-side handling or a service like Formspree or Getform.
